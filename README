Todo list / time management on steriods

Fuse


Todo
-------

startTimeWindow debug
backtime from enddate
self update & purchase for non app store version.
Validate Rules & show clashes

Make a smaller Rule Collection View Item for Sequences x
Changing any rules, reprocesses all events - avoid calanders x
Date not being saved x
Import / Export
Document dirtying x
Undo
Current rule polishing and input validation
New rules

When Rule collection view loses focus it should deselect all cells  x
RuleCollectionView accectDrops from only filtered Rules x
Sort by current time, desc  x
changing start time can only be done before start of 1st node
 - changing start ignores calendar event of that seq
Changing rules, updates nodes only right of that node
Recreate calendar Events if they have been deleted.


Later Versions
-----------------
Muliple sequences to one start / end time
Calendar events become a rule
Rules can also be notifications
Rules is not the right name any more.
right click a node and set a new start time for it.
Rule:  Warn if calendar Event changes more than X




Known Issues
----------------

If the calendar on the users computer has a full resync then the identifiers of calendars and Events will be regenerated and will not be recognised.  (the clunky solution is to store the name, time, and color of events and cals and then refind it)
