    Abstract:
    The definition for the `SequencePresenterType` type. This protocol defines the contract between list presenters and how their lists are presented / archived.
*/

/**
    The `SequencePresenterType` protocol defines the building blocks required for an object to be used as a list
    presenter. List presenters are meant to be used where a `List` object is displayed; in essence, a list
    presenter "fronts" a `List` object. With iOS / OS X apps, iOS / OS X widgets, and WatchKit extensions, we
    can classify these interaction models into list presenters. All of the logic can then be abstracted away
    so that the interaction is testable, reusable, and scalable. By defining the core requirements of a list
    presenter through the `SequencePresenterType`, consumers of `SequencePresenterType` instances can share a common
    interaction interface to a list.

    Types that conform to `SequencePresenterType` have other methods to manipulate a list. For example, a
    presenter can allow for inserting list items into the list and moving a list item from one index.  All of
    these updates require that the `SequencePresenterType` notify its delegate (a `SequencePresenterDelegate`) of
    these changes through the common delegate methods. Each of these methods should be surrounded by
    `listPresenterWillChangeListLayout(_:)` and `sequencePresenterDidChangeNodeLayout(_:)` invocations.  For more
    information about the expectations of how a `SequencePresenterDelegate` interacts with a `SequencePresenterType`,
    see the `SequencePresenterDelegate` protocol comments.

    The underlying implementation of the `SequencePresenterType` may use a `List` object to store certain
    properties as a convenience, but there's no need to do that directly. You query an instance of a
    `SequencePresenterType` for its `archiveableList` representation; that is, a representation of the currently
    presented list that can be archiveable. This may happen, for example, when a document needs to save the
    currently presented list in an archiveable form. Note that list presenters should be used on the main
    queue only.

        in a single `listPresenterWillChangeListLayout(_:isInitialLayout:)` and
        `sequencePresenterDidChangeNodeLayout(_:isInitialLayout:)` invocation. In more complicated implementations
        of this method, you can find the intersection or difference between the new list's presented list items
        and the old list's presented list items, and then call into the remove/update/move delegate methods to
        inform the delegate of the re-organization. Delegates receive updates if the text of a `Node`
        instance has changed. Delegates also receive a callback if the new color is different from the old
        list's color.
