    Abstract:
    The definition for the `SequencePresenterDelegate` type. This protocol defines the contract between the `SequencePresenterType` interactions and receivers of those events (the type that conforms to the `SequencePresenterDelegate` protocol).
*/

/**
    The `SequencePresenterDelegate` type is used to receive events from a `SequencePresenterType` about updates to the
    presenter's layout. This happens, for example, if a `Node` object is inserted into the list or removed
    from the list. For any change that occurs to the list, a delegate message can be called. As a conformer
    you must implement all of these methods, but you may decide not to take any action if the method doesn't
    apply to your use case. For an implementation of `SequencePresenterDelegate`, see the `AllNodesPresenter`
    or `IncompleteNodesPresenter` types.

        list changed, but the presenter couldn't resolve the granular changes. A full layout change includes
        changing anything on the underlying list: list item toggling, text updates, color changes, etc. This
        is invoked, for example, when the list is initially loaded, because there could be many changes that
        happened relative to an empty list--the delegate should just reload everything immediately.  This
        method is not wrapped in `listPresenterWillChangeListLayout(_:isInitialLayout:)` and
