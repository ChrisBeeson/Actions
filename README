Todo list / time management on steriods

Fuse


Todo
-------

When Rule collection view loses focus it should deselect all cells


changing start time can only be done before start of 1st node
 - changing start ignores calendar event of that seq

Changing rules, updates nodes only right of that node



Tabs - Each tab has it's only generic rules - solves the work / life issue


Known Issues
----------------

If the calendar on the users computer has a full resync then the identifiers of calendars and Events will be regenerated and will not be recognised.  (the clunky solution is to store the name, time, and color of events and cals and then refind it)
